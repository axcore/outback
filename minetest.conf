## Mapgen

#    Name of map generator to be used when creating a new world.
#    Creating a world in the main menu will override this.
#    type: enum values: v5, v6, v7, flat, valleys, fractal, singlenode

#    Water surface level of the world.
#    type: int

#    From how far blocks are generated for clients, stated in mapblocks (16 nodes).
#    type: int
# max_block_generate_distance = 6

#    Where the map generator stops.
#    Please note:
#    -    Limited to 31000 (setting above has no effect)
#    -    The map generator works in groups of 80x80x80 nodes (5x5x5 MapBlocks).
#    -    Those groups have an offset of -32, -32 nodes from the origin.
#    -    Only groups which are within the map_generation_limit are generated
#    type: int min: 0 max: 31000
# map_generation_limit = 31000

#    Global map generation attributes.
#    In Mapgen v6 the 'decorations' flag controls all decorations except trees
#    and junglegrass, in all other mapgens this flag controls all decorations.
#    Flags that are not specified in the flag string are not modified from the default.
#    Flags starting with 'no' are used to explicitly disable them.
#    type: flags possible values: caves, dungeons, light, decorations, nocaves, nodungeons, nolight, nodecorations

#### Mapgen Valleys

##### General

#    Map generation attributes specific to Mapgen Valleys.
#    'altitude_chill' makes higher elevations colder, which may cause biome issues.
#    'humid_rivers' modifies the humidity around rivers and in areas where water would tend to pool,
#    it may interfere with delicately adjusted biomes.
#    Flags that are not specified in the flag string are not modified from the default.
#    Flags starting with 'no' are used to explicitly disable them.
#    type: flags possible values: altitude_chill, noaltitude_chill, humid_rivers, nohumid_rivers
