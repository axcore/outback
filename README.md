## Inspiration
The inspiration for this game is my home country, Australia.
I've tried to bring the landscape and flora into the game of Minetest.
Enjoy and think of visiting Australia next time you travel abroad.

## Features
* 21 biomes
* 49 trees and 16 plants native to Australia
* Sea grass, kelp, coral and shipwrecks.
* A new ore, the Opal.

## Installation

### Download
1. [Download](https://github.com/vlapsley/outback/archive/master.zip) the .zip file
2. Extract the .zip archive with an archive manager (WinZip, 7-zip, gunzip...)
3. Rename the directory to *outback* and place it in the `/games` directory of Minetest.

### Using Git
1. Open the terminal (in Linux) or the Git shell (in Windows), and set the working directory (the *mods* folder) using `cd` - for example `cd /home/vlapsley/.minetest/games` or `cd C:\Users\vlapsley\minetest-0.4.14\games`.
2. Clone (download) Outback game: `git clone https://github.com/vlapsley/outback.git`.
3. Next time, you can automatically update the Outback game with the same `cd` command, and `git pull origin master`.
