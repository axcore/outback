## Inspiration
The inspiration for this game is my home country, Australia.
I've tried to bring the landscape and flora into the game of Minetest.
Enjoy and think of visiting Australia next time you travel abroad.

### Biomes
#### Underground
Stone. Australia is rich in resources. Just keep digging!
#### Mangroves
The mangroves of Queensland and Northern Territory. Watch out for crocodiles!
#### Tasman Sea
Beautiful sandy beaches. You will find lots of Brown and Giant Kelp.
#### Great Australian Bight
Sandstone cliffs and wild ocean. The Great White Shark owns these waters.
#### Indian Ocean
Sandy beaches and dolphins.
#### Great Barrier Reef
The worlds largest coral reef off the coast of Queensland.
#### Timor Sea
White sand beaches and palm trees.
#### Jarrah-Karri Forest
The south-west corner of Western Australia. Forests of Jarrah, Karri and Marri.
#### Eastern Coasts
Amazing beaches, the dazzling Illawarra Flame Tree in your garden, and a monstrous Moreton Bay Fig 
to pick fruit from. The east coast of Australia is the perfect place to build your holiday house.
#### Goldfields-Esperence
Hot, dry and lots of nothing in the center and south of Western Australia. Except gold. Lots of 
gold.
#### Top End
Tropical wetlands and sub-tropical savannah in the Northern Territory.
#### Far North Queensland
You'll find the tropical Daintree rainforest near the coastline and eucalypt forests inland along 
the Cape York Peninsula.
#### Pilbara
One of the hottest parts of Australia is the north-west of Western Australia. The rocky, gravel 
surface is red due to the amount of hematite in the ground. You'll find lots of iron ore here. 
Don't forget to bring plenty of water.
#### Tasmania
The island of Tasmania is the most mountainous state in Australia. Much of Tasmania is densely 
forested. The Tarkine, located in island's far North West, is the largest temperate rainforest area 
in Australia. In the south you'll find the tallest flowering tree in the world, Eucalyptus Regnans,
the Swamp Gum.
#### Victorian Forests
The cool mountains and southern, central and north-eastern Victoria are dominated by wet eucalypt 
forests. Blue Gum, White Box and Swamp Gum will all tower over you.
#### Flinders-Lofty
The Flinders-Lofty bioregion in South Australia has a general pattern of mountain ranges, ridges 
and wide, flat plains. Some of Australia's best wines come from this region.
#### Murray-Darling Basin
The Murray–Darling basin is a large geographical area in the interior of southeastern Australia. 
Its name is derived from its two major rivers, the Murray River and the Darling River. River Red 
Gum are known to drop large branches, so watch your head when resting in their shade.
#### Mulga Lands
The Mulga Lands are a bioregion of eastern Australia consisting of dry sandy plains scattered with 
mulga trees.
#### Central Australia
Central Australia, the 'Red Centre', is the place where you will find the most famous monolith, 
Uluru and it is where the heart of the outback beats.
#### Simpson Desert
The area is extremely hot and dry. Famous for it's red sand dunes.
#### Australian Alps
The highest parts of the Great Dividing Range.

#### Wood
**Eucalyptus** - Eucalypts have many uses which have made them important. Because of their fast growth, the main benefit of these trees is the wood. They provide many uses, such as planting in parks and gardens, timber, firewood and pulpwood. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as windbreaks.

**Red Gum** - River Red Gum or simply Red Gum is a native Australian forest tree, it grows extensively beside inland water sources, it also grows well in open areas and farm land relatively close to water. The timber is red in colour varying from a light pink red through to a rich dark red depending on it’s age, weather it has been burnt and how long it has been dead as a log on the ground.

**Southern Sassafras** - Southern Sassafras is an understorey evergreen tree, it grows extremely well in the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania. The "blackheart", an unusual viral fungus which usually affects the tree after storm damage, causes streaks through the heartwood, ranging from light brown through to purple, green and black.

**Tasmanian Oak** - Tasmanian oak is a premium Australian hardwood timber encompassing three species that grow in the mountainous areas of Tasmania, Victoria and south east NSW. It is a versatile timber perfect for both construction and interior applications, including flooring, paneling, architraves and skirting boards.

**Tasmanian Myrtle** - Tasmanian Myrtle does not resemble and is not related to European Myrtle, it became known as "Myrtle" through common usage by the early European loggers. Tasmanian Myrtle is sought after for furniture. It sands well and gives a real luster when oiled or lacquered, it is a reddish pink wood that is well wearing.

## Use
### Mapgen compatibility
The Australia mod has been designed specifically for the Valleys mapgen, currently in Minetest 0.4.14.
It will work with mapgens v5, v7, flat and fractal, but it won't be as visually appealing.
The rivers and temperature/humidity of the Valleys mapgen play a vital role in getting the feel of the Australia mod just right.

### Settings
You can enable/disable biomes by opening the *init.lua* file and changing each biome setting to `1` for enabled or `0` for disabled.
This will also disable plants, trees and more that are unique to that biome.
All biomes are enabled by default. Currently, disabling the *Underground* biome will have no effect.
